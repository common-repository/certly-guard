Certly Guard automatically removes comments that contain malicious links.
== Description ==

Note: Certly Guard is fully compatible with Akismet, and we suggest using them both to protect against more kinds of spam.

Certly Guard for WordPress sends all your comments to the Certly Guard service to determine if they link to any bad content, like malware. Guard uses over four million known malicious URLs to effectively protect your site.

Certly Guard will check up to ten links per day for free. To get started, go to [guard.certly.io](https://guard.certly.io/).

A free API key from Certly Guard is required to use this plugin.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog, activate it, then enter your [Certly Guard](https://guard.certly.io) API key under "Settings" -> "Certly Guard".
